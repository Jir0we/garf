# garf
Garf is near.

# NOTE:
- May need to packmanage (apt//winget) git onto system
- worth looking at python//selenium webdrivers for pulling images
- if no py, git for image pull repo pull of garf
- GARF WILL RISE.
- upload malicious to github
- ability to slowly coat the screen in garf
- windows version AND/OR python version
- needs to be started through Bash/Bat and escalated to Python for more functionality
